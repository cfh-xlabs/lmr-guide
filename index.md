## Introduction
This guide is written and maintained by the XLABS at the Centre for Hypersonics, The University of Queensland. Whilst the GDTK and Eilmer come with a plethora of examples, this guide offers some specific notes and points for building compressible flow simulations with high-temperature gas effects using Eilmer that are relevant to XLABS research.
