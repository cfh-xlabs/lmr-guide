# lmr-guide: An XLabs Guide to CFD
A guide for the use of [eilmer](https://gdtk.uqcloud.net/docs/eilmer/about/) and the broader [Gas Dynamics Toolkit](https://gdtk.uqcloud.net) for problems of interest to the Centre for Hypersonics, xlabs.

## Introduction
This guide is written and maintained by the XLABS at the Centre for Hypersonics, The University of Queensland. Whilst the GDTK and Eilmer come with a plethora of examples, this guide offers some specific notes and points for building compressible flow simulations with high-temperature gas effects using Eilmer that are relevant to XLABS research.

### Testing capabilities... (T. Herik, 2024)
## Testing Code Snippets 
Testing of code snippet capability...
```python
def Alpha()
	return None
```

## Testing math
$\int_{t=0}^t=t_{\alpha}$

^ this does not work yet, will migrate to jekyl to make everything easier.
